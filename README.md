Hi! My name is Lucas and I'm a Brazilian guy that loves PCs and creates open-source software for fun!

Here you will find many tools I have built while studying some technology or simply by personal need or out of curiosity.

I hope some of these tools can help you do or understand something else easier.

## Projects being activelly developed
[Libvirt-Single-GPU-Passthrough](https://github.com/1deterministic/Libvirt-Single-GPU-Passthrough): files and scripts to help you achieve single-gpu passthrough to a virtual machine.

[Playing-With-RT](https://github.com/1deterministic/Playing-With-RT): a (very) simple ray tracer built studying the awesome book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/). Currently implemented in C (with OpenCL and pthread) and Python rendering backends.

## Projects not activelly developed that may return in the future
[1D-Sync](https://github.com/1deterministic/1D-Sync): automated folder synching daemon supporting many filters;

[Scripts](https://github.com/1deterministic/Scripts): installer scripts for many popular programs for Arch, Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora.

[Compress-Encrypt-Upload](https://github.com/1deterministic/Compress-Encrypt-Upload): automation scripts to, well, compress, encrypt and upload backups to the cloud.

[SimpleBench](https://github.com/1deterministic/SimpleBench): simplest and most portable system benchmarking tool I could write.
